## Performance  

I played the latest version of the game as of 17th August 2024. I used the optimized settings according to [BenchmarKing](https://www.youtube.com/@benchmarking4386) on YouTube, at 1440p with DLSS Quality, Framegen OFF.

The game ran super smoothly, no stutters or slowdowns, apart from the occasional fps drop due to a memory leak(?). I'd fix that fps drop by resetting the texture setting from Very High to Low and back to Very High. This happened only a single-digit number of times across my 52 hours of playing.
## Gameplay  

I'll start with the elephant in the room: the combat, and boy is it good. I've never felt more badass while playing a game. The combat centers around parry and dodge mechanics but offers layers of complexity. Parrying has two timings: a basic deflect and a tighter timing that opens up an attack window, catering to both new and skilled players.

You can unlock four different stances, each effective against specific enemy types, adding another layer of strategy. This, combined with quickfire weapons, keeps combat fresh and engaging.

Stealth is essentially easy mode due to the enemy AI's limitations. However, it’s pure fun, with tools like wind chimes and firecrackers to manipulate enemies, along with various assassination techniques(like poison, to terrify your enemies into submission!). The satisfaction of pulling off stealth kills is undeniable, even if the AI is forgiving.

Overall, combat is fast, fluid, and satisfying, with each element flowing smoothly into the other. A balance of head-on fights and stealth leads to the most immersive experience.

Exploration follows the typical open-world formula but refines it into something truly immersive. There’s no compass or minimap, just you, your horse, and the wind guiding you to your destination. The world feels alive, with various points of interest like bamboo stands, fox dens, and quests offering diverse rewards.

Lastly, the leveling system offers a wealth of upgrades, allowing you to tailor Jin’s abilities to your preferred playstyle. As you progress, you unlock various enhancements for your tools, stances, and combat techniques, giving you the freedom to focus on the aspects of combat you enjoy most. Whether you prefer a more defensive approach, focusing on parries and counters, or an aggressive style with powerful offensive moves, the game supports your choices.

You’ll eventually unlock everything if you engage with enough side content, but the journey to get there is rewarding in itself. Each new ability or upgrade feels meaningful, offering noticeable improvements that make Jin more versatile and formidable in battle.

Gear, on the other hand, consists of armor sets that not only provide protection but also alter certain abilities, like improving stealth or boosting damage in combat. These armors can be further customized with charms, which give major and minor boosts in various categories, such as health regeneration, damage resistance, or increased resolve gain. This system adds another layer of depth, allowing you to fine-tune Jin’s capabilities to suit the challenges ahead.

## Art  

With obvious Kurosawa influences, the game perfectly balances cinematic storytelling with gameplay. Duels are dramatic, raids are intense, all backed by a soundtrack that is composed with such care and expertise.

Exploration is gorgeous, with bright, vibrant, and colorful landscapes, oftentimes contrasted by darker, war-torn areas. The attention to detail in the world design is evident in every scene, from the swaying grass underfoot to the distant mountains shrouded in mist. The interplay of light and shadow is masterful, creating an atmosphere that is both immersive and evocative of classic samurai cinema.

Storytelling is top-notch. It does not feel rushed, and does not feel too slow; it's just right. Jin's character arc is deeply resonant, fitting seamlessly into the broader narrative. His journey is one of honor, loss, and the struggle to adapt in a changing world. Alongside him are fully fleshed-out companions, each with their own complete and resolved stories. Their personal quests add depth to the overall experience, making the game not just a visual masterpiece but an emotional one as well.  

## Verdict
  
_Ghost of Tsushima_ is a masterclass in game design, combining stunning visuals, engaging gameplay, and a compelling narrative into an unforgettable experience. The game excels in nearly every aspect, from its fluid and intuitive combat system to its immersive open world that invites exploration without overwhelming the player with unnecessary clutter. The developers' attention to detail shines through, whether in the sweeping landscapes, the nuanced character development, or the seamless integration of cinematic elements that pay homage to classic samurai films. If you're looking for the best samurai game out there, this is the one.
